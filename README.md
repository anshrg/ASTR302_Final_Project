# ASTR302_Final_Project
Final project for ASTR 400B - Observational Astronomy (University of Arizona) 

See the final project report **ASTR 302 Observing Project Written Report Ansh Gupta.pdf** for details on the project, including the datataking procedure, final resultws, and discussion. This project centered on the observation of a confirmed exoplanet, k2-45 b, using the Kuiper Telescope located on Mount Bigelow, Arizona. Using transit data, best-fit exoplanet orbital and object parameters were determined, and these values were compared with those previously determined in the literature. This project utilized the batman exoplanet transit light curve modeling package as described in [Kreidberg 2015](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/683602).
